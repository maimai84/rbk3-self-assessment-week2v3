// List and briefly describe the types of algorithmic time complexity.
// Be as clear and complete as necessary to demonstrate your mastery.
// Write your explanation below as a comment
/*
O(1) constant no time complexity one operation
O(n)  complexity there is  one loop we loop   
log(n) there is tree or book we search in half of the book
O(n^2) there is two operation (two four loop)
